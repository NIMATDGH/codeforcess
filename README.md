# Codeforces Solutions üíª

This repository contains my personal solutions to various **Codeforces** problems.  
Each solution is written in **C++** and named after the corresponding problem ‚Äî so you can easily find the question by searching for the file name on Codeforces.

---

## üß† How It Works
- Every `.cpp` file in this repo is a solution to a Codeforces problem.
- The file name matches the **problem name** or **identifier** (for example: `Two_Buttons.cpp` or `Pair_of_Topics.cpp`).
- You can copy the file name and search it directly on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) to find the original problem statement.
