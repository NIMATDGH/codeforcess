# Codeforces Solutions üíª

This repository contains my personal solutions to various **Codeforces** problems.  
Each solution is written in **C++** and named after the corresponding problem ‚Äî so you can easily find the original question by searching the file name on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).

---

## üß† How It Works
- Every `.cpp` file represents a solution to one Codeforces problem.
- The file name matches the **problem name** or **identifier**.
- To view the problem, just search the file name on Codeforces.
